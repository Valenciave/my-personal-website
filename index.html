        <p>As I grew older, my interest in technology continued to deepen.I would read articles and watch online tutorials, eager to learn more about software development and its limitless possibilities. 
            Ive always had a interest in software engineering since highschool, yet I would never pursue until recently.
            I hope to make a drastic carrer change in my life through this and be where I want to be in life throuh this gate I am opening for myself.
            Ive done a heafty amount of research in this field, to day in the life, to tik toks, to random people explain there day to day basis and I new that 
            this was for me.
